### About
Forkpitch is a platform for your inner critic. We all know that feeling when we come across a "critic" review that we completely disagree with. If you know Pitchfork, you know they are notorious for unnecessarily pretentious and sometimes condescending reviews embodying a sense of "forced criticism". Emily Knepple from [the Daily Cardinal](https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/02/pitchforks-pretentious-problem) says it best, stating that "...most writers talk as if there’s something the reader doesn’t know or maybe wants to but just doesn’t have the artistic intellect that all of their staff somehow embody to do so." 

Who knew that Drake's early career could be described as having ["indelible pop hooks and bleeding-heart lyricism"](https://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/), or that he 

["...sounds comfortable softening his consonants alongside SoundCloud emissary Carti".](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/drake-dark-lane-demo-tapes/). One more, I promise. A review of Lil Yachty's Lil Boat 2 that can be found [here](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-yachty-lil-boat-2/) says "In his quest to conquer the whole yung demo, he discovered teens are fickle and manifold, creatures of varying interests prone to unpredictable changes of heart." and "After being heralded as the harbinger of a new era in rap, the metrics didn’t bear out his impact." What's a harbinger? Maybe we we really don't have that same artistic intellect, but I think sometimes you just have to say its a bop. 

Despite all this, I must admit I am a fan of the site and that it is a great resource to find new music, and yes, sometimes there are reviews I agree with. So, regardless of where you stand, let your voice be heard.

This app uses [this](https://github.com/omardelarosa/pitchfork-npm) third-party API that scrapes Pitchfork review data and lets you to leave your opinions on album reviews and what you think the album rating should be. The app will expand it's functionality to include additional features outlined in the Next Steps section.
